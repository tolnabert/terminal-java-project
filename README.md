# Introduction

In the challenging landscape of the hospitality industry,
hotels face the constant struggle of satisfying guests while efficiently managing resources.
With the emergence of automation technologies, eHotel aims to revolutionize the hospitality experience by automating
various aspects of hotel operations. As a part of this initiative, we introduce the eHotel Buffet Simulator,
a tool designed to optimize buffet management and minimize both guest dissatisfaction and food waste.

# Project Overview

The eHotel Buffet Simulator is a Java-based application that simulates buffet operations within a hotel setting.
The simulator receives information from the guest reservation module to anticipate guest arrivals and adjust
buffet preparations accordingly. The primary objectives of the simulator are:

1. Minimize dissatisfaction by ensuring the buffet remains adequately stocked to meet guest demand.
2. Minimize food waste by accurately predicting and managing food quantities to prevent spoilage.

# Technologies Used
